                    <h1>Become a Web Dev or Game Dev</h1>
                    <img src="coding.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>I've always wanted to create an amazing website that'll impress my friends and make my parents proud. I just love building websites as it activates one's creative mindset and also just pushes me forward especially seeing the result as exactly as I imagined. I'm also a sucker for games so being able to create a game that I've always imagined since childhood would be awesome.</p>

                    <h1>Starting a Family</h1>
                    <img src="Family.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>I always wanted a family. Having a spouse around you on a daily basis can be really helpful for me as I'll have someone who I can share my feelings with without any discomfort. Having children is something I also always wanted because I love children because they are so funny XD.</p>

                    <h1>Graduate from College</h1>
                    <img src="graduate.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>Before any of the plans above I'd like to obviously graduate from college to then pursue my other future goals. College is just one part of my journey to fulfill my dreams.</p>
