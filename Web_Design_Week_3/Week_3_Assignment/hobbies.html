                    <h1>Gaming</h1>
                    <img src="gaming.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>This is my most favorite hobby. It's really common to be a popular hobby for boys my age. It just brings us to our own world which we use to escape reality. It can help those who are suffering mental illnesses such as depression and can be used also as a source of comfort in times of hearbreak.</p>

                    <h1>Football</h1>
                    <img src="football.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>This the most popular sport in the world, it's on of my favorite. Playing football with friends brings excitement and entertainment to the sport and to me as an individual. I can see this sport no way close to ever dying in the future as it can be played by both male and female and fill both with the same level of entertainment.</p>

                    <h1>Watching Anime</h1>
                    <img src="anime.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>This is one of my favourite hobbies as when I get bored of the first 2 I can easily use this one to fill in the gap. Anime is a growing genre of animation around the world. I never liked Anime growing up but as I started actually watching a few, it brought alot of interest and raised my eyes to how entertaining watching anime is.</p>
